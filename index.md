### In a nutshell
Having some sense of how one's mindfulness would develop over time is useful while pursuing mindfuness practice.  

In this paper, the case for viewing mindfulness skill as a skill that can be developed over three stages, namely, cognitive, associative, and autonomous stage, is presented. 

Those familiar with motor skills acquisition learning literature would be familiar with the deliberation of these three stages, attributed to Fitts and Posner's work. Jeffery Hubber's [excerpt](https://us.humankinetics.com/blogs/excerpt/understanding-motor-learning-stages-improves-skill-instruction) on this model is a handy resource for those who are unfamiliar with it.   

In summary, it is posited that development in mindfulness practice can be appreciated in light of the three stages of learning model as follow: 

__Cognitive Stage__
   * It is important to get the instructions for mindfulness practice right at the start. E.g., Do you know what it means by paying attention to your breathing? What will you do when you are distracted?
   * Abstract concepts regarding mindfulness practice need to be made concrete and clarified. E.g., If noticing the breathe is too hard, putting your finger under your nostril to be aware of the air may make the mindfulness practice more concrete. If you do not understand what is being open and nonjudmental, find out what it means within the context of mindfulness practice will go a long way.  
   * Receiving feedback about how your mindfulness practice is going is important at this initial stage.  

 __Associative Stage__
   * Once the basic instructions are assimilated, one would tend to use the mindfulness strategy in daily living situations (and, for athletes, in sports).
   * Cues in daily life can activate one's intention to be mindful. E.g., While walking, objects on the floor can be cues for one to be mindful of the moment.   

 __Autonomous Stage__
   * Mindfulness becomes a second nature, and habitual.
   * Sense of [equanimity](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007%2Fs12671-013-0269-8) developed.
